	<p>Deep Symbolic Execution Agent (DEEPSEA) is a program analysis
		tool.</p>

	<p>With these tools it monitors the execution of a Java program. As
		the program executes concretely, DEEPSEA collects information to
		describe the execution trace symbolically. At the end of the
		execution, the path is modified and the
		[Green](http://www.green.green) library is used to find a model for
		the modified path condition.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To install DEEPSEA, simply import the project in Eclipse.  If you are using another IDE, you may have to import it or manually tweak the settings.</p>

<p>You will have to make sure that the build path is set correctly.  It must include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/tools.jar</code></li>
</ul>


You may have to *tweak* the location of the library.

Create a run configuration for DEEPSEA:
 
  * In the "Arguments" tab, set the "Working directory" (at the bottom of the panel) to "Other" and fill in
     
        ${workspace_loc:deepsea/bin}

<h2>Usage</h2>

To use DEEPSEA:

 1. Highlight a target program properties file (either in an editor window or in the Eclipse navigator).
 2. Launch the DEEPSEA run configuration.

The <a href="configuration.html">Configuration file</a> page describes the settings.
