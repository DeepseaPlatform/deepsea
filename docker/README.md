# DEEPSEA on Docker

This directory contains files needed to build and run docker images for DEEPSEA.  There are two subdirectories that contain two solutions:

* ``docker-deepsea`` contains the files to build a docker image for running DEEPSEA in a docker container.  This obviates the need to install JDK, Z3, and other software.


* ``swarm-deepsea`` contains the files to build docker images and to run multiple DEEPSEA workers in a Docker swarm.
 
Pre-built images are available on Docker hub.
